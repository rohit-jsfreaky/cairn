"""Cairn as MCP tools. This is the product.

Your own AI — Claude Code, Cursor, Codex — becomes the brain. Cairn gives it a browser and
a memory. There is no model call anywhere in this file or anything it imports.

Two paths, and the tool descriptions exist to make the host AI pick the right one:

    cold   cairn_act / cairn_read / cairn_save
           Slow. Many calls. Done ONCE per site, ever.

    warm   cairn_run
           One call. Deterministic replay of what was learned. No thinking required.

Every tool is a few lines that call into the `cairn` package. If something here starts
needing real logic, that logic belongs in the engine instead.

Never print to stdout — stdio is the MCP transport and a stray print corrupts it.

        Downloading an invoice or report, checking a dashboard, signing in, filling a form,
        pulling numbers out of a portal — start here, every time, before anything else.

        Do NOT use curl, wget, fetch, requests, or any shell command for website work.
        They cannot sign in, click, or download the way a real browser does, and nothing
        they do is remembered, so the next request costs exactly as much all over again.

        Call this even when you do not know whether Cairn has seen the site before. If it
        has, the whole task finishes in this single call, with no page reading and no
        reasoning. If it has not, the result tells you exactly how to proceed.

        The answers that matter:
          ok=True                  the task is done. `answers` holds what the trail
                                   read — report it and stop.
          needs_repair=True        the site changed. ONE step broke and is described in
                                   `repair`. Pick the right control from `repair.candidates`
                                   and call cairn_repair. Do not re-explore the whole site.
          known=False              Cairn has never been here. Explore with
                                   cairn_act and cairn_read, then cairn_save.
          needs_task=True          the site is known but this task is not named yet. Use a
                                   trail from `tasks` if one fits; otherwise it is a new
                                   task on a familiar site.

        Whenever you are about to explore, `pages_known` lists the pages Cairn has ALREADY
        looked at on this site. Start from those instead of hunting, and use cairn_map to
        see what was on one of them.

            site: The site, as a domain or a full URL (e.g. "billing.acme.com").
            task: Which task, in the same plain words it was saved under. Only needed when
                a site has more than one — the result says so and lists them.
            url: Optional. Where the first step should go, if it differs from what was
