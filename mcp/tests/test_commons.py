"""The handoff, through the tools a host AI actually sees.

The engine tests prove the memory moves. These prove the AI is told the right thing at the
right moment — which is the part that decides whether the handoff happens at all. On the
first live test of this project a host AI ignored Cairn entirely and reached for `curl`,
so what the descriptions say is not decoration.
