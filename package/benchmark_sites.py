"""Two dozen real websites, learned once, then replayed from memory.

Run it yourself:

    .venv/Scripts/python package/benchmark_sites.py

Every site here is PUBLIC and needs no login, so anyone can rerun this and get their own
numbers. That is the point: a benchmark nobody can reproduce is a claim, not evidence.

What is measured, and what each number honestly means:

- **tool calls** — what the AI has to issue. The thing it actually pays attention to.
- **page reads** — how many times a whole control list was handed over. This is the
  expensive half of using a website with a model.
- **bytes to model** — how much text the tool hands back across the task. The nearest
  honest proxy for tokens. We do not claim token counts: measuring those needs a model,
  and this file deliberately uses none.
- **model calls** — zero throughout. Replay is plain Python.
- **seconds** — the least interesting column. There is no model thinking in here, and
  thinking time is the cost memory actually removes.

The cold run is SCRIPTED: the steps a host AI would take, written by hand. A real model
takes more calls than this, not fewer, because it has to read the page to decide what to do
next. So the cold numbers are a FLOOR, and the saving shown is the smallest one honestly
available.

Sites move, and some block automated browsers outright. Failures are printed in the table
rather than dropped — a table with only successes in it is marketing.
