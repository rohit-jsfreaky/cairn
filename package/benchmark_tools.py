"""The same task, the same sites, through four different browser tools.

Run it yourself (needs Node for the two npx servers):

    .venv/Scripts/python package/benchmark_tools.py

Every tool is driven the way a host AI drives it: as an MCP server over stdio, counting the
calls it has to make and measuring the bytes it hands back. That is the fair lens, because
it is the only thing the model actually pays for.

WHAT THIS IS NOT. Playwright MCP and Chrome DevTools MCP are not trying to remember
anything, and nothing here suggests they are broken. They are excellent at what they do.
The comparison is narrow and stated plainly:

    Run 1: everyone is about the same.
    Run 2: everyone pays it again. Cairn does not.

That is the whole claim, and the second row is the only one where the tools differ.

The steps for each tool are written by hand, identically: open the page, look at it, read
one value. A real model takes MORE calls than this on every tool, so the numbers are a
floor for all of them equally.

`browser-use` is measured separately, because it needs an API key and real money; its
numbers and the exact command are in the results file rather than pretended to here.
