"""The cold path: the three verbs a host AI drives.

    look()    what is on this page?
    act()     do one thing, and tell me what changed
    verify()  did the thing I expected actually happen?

There is no model in this file and there never will be. The AI calling these verbs is
somebody else's — normally the user's Claude Code, through `mcp/`. Cairn's job is to make
each call cheap to reason about and to write down what happened, so that the same task
never needs a model again.

`act()` records four independent descriptors of whatever it touched. That redundancy is
the entire reason a redesign is usually survivable: lose the CSS id, keep the link target.
