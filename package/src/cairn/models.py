# is database-wide. An unbounded map would not just spoil itself — it would stop trails,
# site knowledge and the commons from being written at all, mid-run. These two numbers
# are the guard, and a test holds them.
# Forty pages and fifty controls each measures at ~230 KB of JSON, and Sibyl's search
# index roughly doubles that. Sixty pages was the first guess; it made one site cost
# nearly half a megabyte, which is a lot to spend on one site inside a 5 MB database.
