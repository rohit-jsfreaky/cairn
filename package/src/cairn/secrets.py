"""Passwords never go into memory.

Cairn remembers *that* a step types a password, never *which* password. The trail stored in
Sibyl holds a marker like `secret: "password"`; the value itself is looked up at replay time
from the machine it runs on.

Two places are checked, in order:

1. An environment variable, which is what `package/CLAUDE.md` asks for:
       CAIRN_SECRET_BILLING_ACME_COM_PASSWORD
2. `~/.cairn/secrets.json`, which is easier for a person to manage:
       { "billing.acme.com": { "password": "..." } }

Neither lives in the repo, and neither is ever written to memory. If a secret is missing,
replay stops and says exactly which one to set — it never guesses and never falls back to
something stored earlier.
