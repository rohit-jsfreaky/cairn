"""The hands. Playwright, wrapped so the rest of Cairn never touches it directly.

Three things here matter more than the rest:

1. **A snapshot is a short list of controls, not the page HTML.** Handing a host AI 200 kB
   of markup is exactly the cost Cairn exists to remove. `snapshot()` returns the handful
   of things you can actually act on, with four different ways to find each one.

2. **There are two browser modes, and the difference is deliberate.**

   *Profile mode* (the default in real use) keeps one Chrome profile at
   `~/.cairn/browser-profile`, so you stay signed in between runs exactly as you do in
   your own browser. Some logins — Google, Microsoft, anything with a one-time code —
   cannot be automated at all, and should not be: you sign in once by hand and the session
   is kept.

   *Clean mode* (`profile=None`) throws the browser away every time. Tests use it, and so
   does any demo where the login itself must be shown happening rather than assumed.

3. **Being signed in is not the same as remembering.** The profile holds who you are. Sibyl
   memory holds what Cairn knows about a site. Delete the memory and Cairn is still logged
   in, but has no idea what to click and has to explore again — the deletion test is
   untouched by any of this.
