"""Typed events. Library code emits these; it never prints.

The CLI renders them for a human, the backend will stream them to the dashboard, and the
MCP server turns them into tool output. One source of truth for "what just happened",
three different audiences.

The memory events are not decoration. `MemoryRead` and `MemoryWrite` are how a watcher —
including a judge — can see that memory is actually doing the work rather than being
carried along for show.
