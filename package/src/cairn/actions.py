"""Every way Cairn can act on an element.

This is a registry, not a chain of `if` statements. Each action carries what it needs, what
its value means, and how to prove it landed — so the MCP tool description, the replay
dispatcher and the postcondition defaults all read from one place. Adding an action means
adding one entry.

Full audit of what is here and what was deliberately left out: `package/BROWSING.md`.

Two rules hold throughout:

- **Nothing here resolves an element.** An action is handed an already-resolved Playwright
  locator. That keeps this file independent of how targets are found, which matters because
  the snapshot layer is being replaced underneath it.
- **An action that changes nothing is not recorded.** `highlight` draws a box for a human
  watching; replaying it later would be meaningless. Those are marked `recordable=False`.
