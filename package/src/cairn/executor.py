"""The warm path. Deterministic replay, with ZERO model calls.

This file is the product. Everything else supports it.

Replaying a step means: try the stored locators in confidence order, do the action, then
check the postcondition. Three outcomes:

  lands on the first locator   the common case, costs nothing
  lands on a later locator     the site changed cosmetically; we re-rank and move on,
                               still with no model involved
  every locator misses         a real break. Cairn stops, and hands back ONE step for the
                               host AI to work out. Not the whole task, one step.

`model_calls` is hard-coded to 0 in the metrics for a replay, because there is no code
path here that could make one. If that ever stops being true, this docstring is a lie and
the deletion gate is worthless.

THE WARM PATH NEVER READS THE COMMONS. Not once, not as a fallback, not to peek.
Replay may only follow a trail this agent holds in its own memory, because that is
exactly what `cairn forget` takes away — and if replay could reach into the shared
memory instead, `test_deletion_gate.py` would be proving nothing at all. Another
agent's trail has to be deliberately borrowed first, which copies it here, which is
what makes it forgettable.
