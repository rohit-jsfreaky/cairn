"""The page, as Playwright's own accessibility snapshot sees it.

This replaces about sixty lines of hand-written JavaScript that walked the DOM looking for
a fixed list of tags. That collector could only see what it was told to look for, and it
could not see:

- anything inside a shadow DOM
- anything inside an iframe
- a `div` with a click handler pretending to be a button, which is most of the modern web

On a page containing all three plus a late-loading link, the old collector found **one**
element. This finds seven, and can act on every one of them.

Two things make it work. `aria_snapshot(mode="ai")` returns a `ref` for every node, and
`aria-ref=<ref>` is a selector that resolves it again — through shadow roots and across
frame boundaries. A ref is good for one snapshot only and must never reach memory; what
gets stored is the durable descriptors in `describe.py`.
