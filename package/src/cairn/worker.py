"""Keeps one browser on one thread, so it can be driven from anywhere.

Playwright's sync API binds every object it creates to the thread that created it, and it
refuses to start inside a running asyncio loop. An MCP server breaks both rules: it runs an
event loop, and it hands each tool call to whichever worker thread happens to be free.

So instead of fighting it, the browser gets a thread of its own and every call is posted to
that thread. `cairn_look` and `cairn_act` arriving on different threads is then irrelevant —
the browser only ever sees one.

This lives in the engine rather than in `mcp/` because it is a property of driving a
browser, not a property of speaking MCP. The backend will need exactly the same thing.
