"""Waiting for a page to be ready.

This is what modern sites need most. A React dashboard is blank until its data arrives, so
a `look()` that happens too early sees an empty page and the trail records nothing useful.
Guessing a number of seconds is the alternative, and a guess is either too short and flaky
or too long and slow on every single run forever.

Every wait here has a subject: a URL, an element, some text, the network going quiet. None
of them is a sleep. The one real sleep Cairn has is the `wait` action, whose own
description tells the caller to prefer these.
