"""Same route, different subject.

"message ankush" today and "message riya" tomorrow is ONE route with one thing swapped.
Storing a separate trail per person is not memory, it is a filing cabinet, and it means the
second person costs full price forever.

Before this, the matcher scored those two as nearly identical — every word matches but one —
and replayed the stored trail unchanged. Asking for pannly's search clicks returned
vouchley's number. Asking to message riya would have messaged ankush.

The promise this file pins down: **Cairn will aim a route at a new subject, but it will not
act until it can see that subject on the thing it is about to act on.**
