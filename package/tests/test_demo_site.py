"""The demo site is a test fixture, so it needs testing too.

These tests pin down the contract the repair tests will rely on later: variant B must
break exactly one locator and leave everything else alone. If someone edits the demo site
and accidentally changes two things, the repair demo stops being a repair demo, and these
tests are what catches that.
