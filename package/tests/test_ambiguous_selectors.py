"""A selector that matches several things is a question, not an instruction.

The worst bug Cairn has had. On a table with a menu button in every row,
`button[aria-haspopup="menu"]` matched all of them; Cairn clicked the first one and
returned ok. The person who reported it spent eight calls hunting a fault in their own
application that was never there.

It is worse than an ordinary wrong answer for two reasons. It reports SUCCESS, so nothing
downstream has any reason to doubt it. And `cairn_save` then writes it into a trail, where
it is replayed for ever.

Playwright refuses the same selector for the same reason. Cairn now does too — except for
the two reads whose whole purpose is to match many.
