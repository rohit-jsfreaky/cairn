"""A finished run must not hand back a site that is still moving.

Reported from a real marketplace. Replaying an admin sign-in worked perfectly — four steps,
half a second, `ok: true` — and then:

    cairn_read(kind="url")  ->  ".../admin/sign-in/"     # looks like it failed

The sign-in HAD succeeded; the app's redirect was simply still in flight. But a caller
reading the URL straight afterwards concludes the trail is broken and goes off to explore a
site Cairn already knew, which is the exact cost this project exists to remove.

The shape that causes it is specific, and it is the commonest shape there is: a submit
BUTTON. It has no href to hint that navigation is coming, so nothing recorded at learn time
says the address will change, and the last step's check passes on the page it was already
on.

Trails that end in a READ — the answer, which is most of them — have nothing in flight and
wait for nothing.
