"""A trail has to produce the answer, not just arrive at the page.

Found on GitHub, 2026-09-02, the first real site Cairn ever touched. Asked "how many open
issues does microsoft/playwright have", it explored, got 151, and saved a trail of exactly
one step: the `goto`. The number came from a read, and reads were not recorded.

So the saved trail navigated somewhere and stopped. Every later run still had to read the
page and work the number out again — which is the entire cost the project exists to remove.

# `.price_color`, which matches SEVEN elements, so the read is refused — correctly, since
# guessing would report another book's price for ever. But the refusal NAMES the matches,
# so the caller reads the value straight out of the refusal, answers the user, and never
# makes a successful read. The trail then walks three pages and hands back nothing, on
# every run, and the warm path costs as much as the cold one.

# The caller always has the value at that point. So `save` takes it, and Cairn does the
# part it is good at: find which element says exactly that, and write down every durable
# way of finding that element again.
