"""The map: what Cairn saw on the way, not just where it was going.

Cairn's memory used to be keyed by (site, task) and nothing else. So walking to the
requests page to submit a request meant SEEING the list, the view button and the other six
sidebar items — and throwing every bit of it away. The next day, "view a request" explored
that same page blind.

Found by Rohit on a real client marketplace, driving its end-to-end tests: the first run
cost the same as plain Playwright, because every task was a stranger on a site Cairn had
already walked twenty times.

This file proves the four things that make the map trustworthy rather than merely present:
it records what was actually seen, it cannot grow without end, it never claims to be
current, and `cairn forget` takes it with everything else.
