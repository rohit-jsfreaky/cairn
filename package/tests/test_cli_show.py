"""`cairn show` on a site that remembers more than one thing.

This is the command a judge reaches for to see what memory actually holds, and it used to
answer "nothing remembered for marketplace.example" about a site holding three trails.
`load_playbook` has no branch for "several trails, no task named", so it fell through every
case and returned None — and the one command whose whole job is to show you memory told you
memory was empty.
