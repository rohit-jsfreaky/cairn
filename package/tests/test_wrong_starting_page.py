"""Replaying a trail somewhere it does not start.

The dangerous lookalike. "This control moved" and "we are on a completely different page"
look identical from inside a step, and reporting the second as the first invites a repair
that binds a healthy step to whatever happened to be lying around. Replaying a sign-in while
already signed in lands on a dashboard and offered twenty-three nav links as candidates for
an email field.

The version of this that shipped could not fire at all on a real trail. It read `Step.page`,
which only exists on trails learned after that field was added and which nothing backfills —
so every trail saved before it opted out silently, forever, and the tests all passed because
every one of them set `page=` by hand. The trail is now read for its own geography instead.
