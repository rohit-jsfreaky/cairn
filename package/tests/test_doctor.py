"""`cairn doctor` — the command a stranger runs when nothing works.

Everything Cairn needs that is not Python code has produced a confusing failure at some
point in this project: a browser that installs separately, a profile Chrome refused, a
missing screen, a home folder it cannot write to. This command exists so none of those has
to be met as a traceback in the middle of a run.

These tests are about the REPORTING, not the environment: what it says when something is
broken, and whether it knows the difference between essential and optional.
