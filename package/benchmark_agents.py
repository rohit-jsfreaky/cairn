"""The real benchmark: one model, one task, four browser tools, three runs each.

    .venv/Scripts/python package/benchmark_agents.py --sites 1 --runs 3     # a pilot
    .venv/Scripts/python package/benchmark_agents.py                        # the sweep

Everything before this measured Cairn against ITSELF — cold versus warm — which is a
before-and-after, not a benchmark. Here every tool is driven by the same real model doing
the same real job, so the rows are comparable the way a model card's rows are.

    Playwright MCP        driven by Claude
    Chrome DevTools MCP   driven by Claude
    Cairn                 driven by Claude
    browser-use           driven by its own model (below)

The axis is REPETITION, because that is what actually happens: a daily invoice check, a
test suite on every commit, a dashboard read every morning. Nobody does a web task once.
Run 1 is where Cairn loses — it pays an extra call to write the trail down — and the
number worth reading is which run it overtakes on.

`browser-use` is the odd row on purpose. It brings its own model, so it is the only one
that cannot answer without thinking, and the only one with a `model calls` column that is
not zero. It runs on OpenRouter; everything else runs on Claude.

A plain Playwright script is deliberately NOT here. It scores zero forever, but only
because a person wrote the selectors by hand and rewrites them when the site moves — which
is a different activity, not a better score.

Needs: the `claude` CLI signed in, Node for the two npx servers, and OPENROUTER_API_KEY
for the browser-use row only.
