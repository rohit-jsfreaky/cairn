"""The same task, on the same site, five mornings running.

Run it yourself:

    .venv/Scripts/python package/benchmark.py

It uses the demo site in `package/tests/demo_site/`, because that is the only site whose
redesign can be switched on and off on purpose — `?variant=b` renames and moves the
controls, which is what Thursday is. Everything else here is a real browser doing real
work against a real HTTP server.

Two things this deliberately does NOT flatter:

- **Monday's tool calls are counted from a script**, not from a language model exploring.
  A real host AI takes noticeably more than this, because it has to look at the page to
  decide what to do next. The number below is therefore the FLOOR of what memory saves.
- **The clock is honest and unimpressive.** This benchmark contains no model thinking time,
  and thinking time is the cost memory actually removes. Compare the calls and the page
  reads; the seconds are the least interesting column here.
