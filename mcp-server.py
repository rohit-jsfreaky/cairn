"""Start Cairn's MCP server using this repo's virtualenv, on any operating system.

`.mcp.json` is read by Claude Code the moment somebody opens this repo, before anyone has
activated anything. It used to name `.venv/Scripts/cairn-mcp.exe` directly, which is a
Windows path — so a judge on a Mac or Linux got a broken server before reading a word of
the README. JSON cannot choose a path based on the operating system; this file can.

If your system has no plain `python` on PATH (some macOS setups only have `python3`), skip
this and wire the server up explicitly instead — the README's Install section shows the
command for both layouts.
